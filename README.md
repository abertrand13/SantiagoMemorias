# Open Notebook: A Proposal to Understand Chile's Memory
[that's a working title]

*Alex Bertrand*
*Trail of Memory*

## Tema

### Broadly...
To understand how Chileans have formed memories around the history of their country, and what it might say about the country today.  Chile is somewhat of a special case in many regards, inasmuch as it has a very important, and very pivotal sequence of events floating in relatively recent memory.  Pinochet's military dictatorship could be argued to form the underpinnings of many of the most powerful memories of Chileans today.

### The Main Problem
Understanding the memory of the people of a country - namely how it has been formed, and what that means for today - requires a level of cultural understanding and immersion that I simply do not have.  This is not in and of itself a bad thing, as I would suggest that the requisite level of 
cultural engagement takes a literal lifetime to acquire.  But it does present an (at least personal issue) for drawing conclusions about a specific aspect of Chilean culture.

I've come to draw a parallel between Chile and, for example, New York City.  First, I believe it's telling that, despite having spent the first 18 years of my life just an hour away from The Greatest City In The World (TM) I still feel very uncomfortable describing life there.  And more importantly, it has come to serve as a more intelligible analogy for me.  I could spend all day sitting on a park bench in the Bronx, without ever successfully understanding what it was like to live there.  Worse, I could draw conclusions - it's not hard for the casual onlooker to determine that the average socioeconomic level of an inner city neighborhood is on the lower end, but calling the area something like 'unsafe' and signing off is counterproductive on two levels.  Firstly, it comes nowhere close to describing the daily life of the average resident, and may in fact be wrong - or at the very least based on the wrong information.  And secondly, it feigns to answer the larger questions, e.g. 'What is it like to live in the Bronx', while in actuality completely avoiding it.

### A Proposed Solution
This, I believe, is the type of problem that would most easily be corrected by interviews.  The problem there is that there's really only time to do one, which carries a number of issues - selection of interviewee (especially when perhaps the largest relevant topic, the dictadorial years, is exceedingly polarizing), and the idea that almost no one person can represent the different sections of Chile's (notably, very classist) society.

It is for this reason that I have been thinking about trying to gather information from a large number of people, ideally from different backgrounds and schools of thought.  Given the time constraints, the quantity of information from each person would be necessarily very small.  And I believe that's alright.  In the interest of being informed on a wide range of ideas, it is arguably better because of the equality that's built in to limiting how much any one person can say.

The main difficulty with this idea, I believe, is that encouraging contribution will be difficult.  How does one go about collecting memories from a large number of people, particularly when it will in all likelihood not benefit them, and there is only half a shared language?  Also, what are the ethical ramifications of studying people's memories like this?

I would propose to facilitate this by a sort of 'social experiment'.  In this day and age, people share information mostly through their phones, and so it makes a degree of intuitive sense to allow them to share their memories in this way.  There are a few options available - at this point, after a number of considerations, it seems most feasible to build a simple mobile site (quite literally, just a well formatted text box or two) in which people can enter a memory, and another from which anyone can view all the memories on one page.  This would not, I anticipate, take too long, and could be made with relative simplicity.

From there, the challenge becomes getting people to participate.  I have considered this, but as it is currently 3:56, I will elaborate on my thoughts at another time.

## Meta General
Understand the interplay between memory and history.  Understand how this affects me personally, and how it affects people in general.  Most importantly for me, understand how the things we've learned about have played out in Chile.

## Objetivos Particulares del Proyecto
Gain the best understanding I can of the last point above.  Or, propose a project that would allow me to do so given more time.

## Posibles Resultados
This depends very much on what I actually do...

## ¿Qué necesitamos hacer?
1. Think, and outline the project more.  What am I going to do?  Am I going to propose it, or actually do it as well?  Or will I do none of the above?
2. If there is technical work to be done, do it.  Assuming an SMS-based interface
  - server and api
  - database
  - front end display
  - sms number interface
3. Review what we've read about memory and history, and use it to inform:
  - choice of project
  - execution of project

## Two Proposals
1. Text (or otherwise digitally communicate) a memory.  View them all in one place.
2. Open notebook - write a story, view other people's.

## Questions - Rhetorical and otherwise

#### What makes this different from other memory-collecting things?
Well, the first question is - what other memory-collecting things?  There are a lot of variations on the same topic, but it's difficult to generalize.  So Krumb is a thing, but I haven't really heard of it doing anything.  Then you've got HONY, which is probably the closest to this, but it's not focused on general memory.  And then you've got different projects, like infanciaendictadura.cl, but it's a little bit different.  It's not getting stories, it's getting artifacts.  In some sense they're one and the same, but I don't think they can be equated completely.

#### How will getting stories from people help you to **understand**?  How does that replace the gap in understanding you say you have because of not being a Chilean?
What I'm hoping is that by letting the Chileans do as much speaking for themselves as possible, I'll be able to take a sort of back seat.  I've come to believe, increasingly, that oftentimes the best thing to do is just to give people a little prod, and then sit back and let them talk for as long as they want and possibly more.  In the ideal case, I get a flood of memories, of all types, attached to different landmarks in the city.  So I get one young man's story of romance in the park.  I get another college student's story of protesting in Plaza Italia.  I get an older woman's recounting of the what happened the day La Moneda was bombed.  And the feelings come through in all of those, and we start to see how Santiaguinos think of Santiago, and how Chileans think of Chile.  And I haven't had to make a single inference, or assume anything.  I just let what they think and how they feel dictate what I write.

#### What do you feel the shortcomings of doing a regular interview are?
I don't feel like I'll really be able to say something about Chilean society and memory as a whole.  Just one person.  Which I guess is alright, but it doesn't speak to the feeling I have tugging at me that I want to understand.  Also, I'm scared of people.

#### You want to understand?  Elaborate.
I've always been told that I will never fit in to a culture like this that's not my own.  I've come to accept that as essentially true.  It was told to me as a mechanism of defense (don't pretend for a second that people who want to won't be able to pick you out of a crowd) but it's come to influence how I view the world as well.  I feel a strong separation between myself and, well, everyone else.  In Chile, there are Chileans, and then there's me.  And that's true to varying extents.  But I definitely feel like I can't think about this country the same way they do.  I don't have the same things informing my viewpoints.  It manifests itself most strongly on a socioeconomic level - I know that I will never know what it's like to go through the day to day routine of survival that I believe many here do - but even when I think about people who are otherwise very similar to me I still think it exists.

Although - maybe that's not the most true.  Maybe all I really want is to be able to empathize with the people 'at the bottom'?

If a typical Chilean college student walked through the Museo De Memoria, for example, what would they feel?  What would I feel?  Good god, nevermind, these are their close family members we could be talking about.  Same thing about the cemetery.  Yea, okay, back to the whole "I'm an outsider thing"

#### And why not a regular ethnography?
Let's continue with the Museo de la Memoria.  Did I find it powerful?  Yes.  Well, mostly.  Could I probably write a reasonably adequate piece on how the curation and layout affects how one walks through and remembers things?  Yes.  But **the most powerful stimuli are going to come from people for whom various artifacts in the museum recall, vividly, certain poignant memories in their life**.  This is the widow who remembers the lines she had to wait in to get food for her family right before Allende fell.  Or the now adult who remembers his dad getting home particularly early some nights.  Or the college student who has seen the scars his grandparents wear.  Or seen their parents cry every once in a while for some reason that they just can't quite understand themselves.  Not being able to understand is okay too sometimes, I guess.

#### What makes this project distinctly Chilean?
Hmmmm...I'm not sure.  On one side, my desire to learn about a culture that I'm not part of works just about anywhere.  On the other, what about this is unique to Chile?  Well, one thing is that they have this big, looming thing that happened really recently.  And that affected a ton of people.  So that's definitely special-ish, although if we're being fair there is recent tragedy all over the world.

Another thing that's special about Chile is it's interesting combination of stability today and lack thereof 'yesterday'.  There were quite a few military dictatorships and such in Latin America, but of all the countries in which that happened Chile has come out on top.  It might contribute to a real quick smoothing over of memory, especially for the youth.  **How do current conditions affect our formation, and interpretation, of memories we have?** (This is some Screen Memories stuff right here).  Or, it might not.  The hurt might still run really deep.

#### What do our readings have to do with all of this?
Don't really know.  Gonna table it for now.

## Code Shenanigans

#### Things to Do Still
- bulletproofing
- autofill location
- location control?
